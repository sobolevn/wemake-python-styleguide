These checks finds flaws in your application design.

We try to stick to "the magical 7 Â± 2 number".

That's how many objects we can keep in our memory at a time.
We try hard not to exceed the limit.

What we call "design flaws":

1. Complex code (there are a lof of complexity checks!)
2. Nested classes, functions

    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.

class NestedFunctionViolation(ASTStyleViolation):
    """
    This rule forbids to have nested functions.

    Reasoning:
        Nesting functions is a bad practice.
        It is hard to test them, it is hard then to separate them.
        People tend to overuse closures, so it's hard to manage the dataflow.

    Solution:
        Just write flat functions, there's no need to nest them.
        Pass parameters as normal arguments, do not use closures.
        Until you need them for decorators or factories.

    We also disallow to nest ``lambda`` functions.

    This rule forbids to have nested classes.

    Reasoning:
        Nested classes are really hard to manage.
        You can not even create an instance of this class in many cases.
        Testing them is also really hard.

    Solution:
        Just write flat classes, there's no need nest them.
        If you are nesting classes inside a function for parametrization,
        then you will probably need to use different design (or metaclasses).

class TooManyLocalsViolation(ASTStyleViolation):
    """
    This rule forbids to have too many local variables in the unit of code.

    Reasoning:
        Having too many variables in a single function is bad thing.
        Soon, you will find troubles to understand what this variable means.
        It will also become hard to name new variables.

    Solution:
        If you have too many variables in a function, you have to refactor it.

    What counts as a local variable? We only count variable as local
    in the following case: it is assigned inside the function body.

    Example::

        def first_function(param):
            first_var = 1

        def second_function(argument):
            second_var = 1
            argument = int(argument)
            third_var, _ = some_call()

    In this example we will count as locals only several variables:

    1. ``first_var``, because it is assigned inside the function's body
    2. ``second_var``, because it is assigned inside the function's body
    3. ``argument``, because it is reassigned inside the function's body
    4. ``third_var``, because it is assigned inside the function's body

    Please, note that ``_`` is a special case. It is not counted as a local
    variable. Since by design it means: do not count me as a real variable.

    This rule is configurable with ``--max-local-variables``.

class TooManyArgumentsViolation(ASTStyleViolation):
    """
    This rule forbids to have too many arguments for a function or method.

    Reasoning:
        This is an indicator of a bad design. When function requires many
        arguments it shows that it is required to refactor this piece of code.
        It also indicates that function does to many things at once.

    Solution:
        Split function into several functions.
        Then it will be easier to use them.

class TooManyElifsViolation(ASTStyleViolation):
    """
    This rule forbids to use many ``elif`` branches.

    Reasoning:
        This rule is specifically important, because many ``elif``
        branches indicate a complex flow in your design:
        you are reimplementing ``switch`` in python.

    Solution:
        There are different design patters to use instead.
        For example, you can use some interface that
        just call a specific method without ``if``.

    """
    This rule forbids placing too many ``return`` statements into the function.

    Reasoning:
        When there are too many ``return`` keywords,
        functions are hard to test. They are also hard to read and
        hard to change and keep everything inside your head at once.

        If nesting is too deep that indicates of a complex logic
        and language constructions. This means that our design is not
        suited to handle such construction.

    Solution:
        We need to refactor our complex construction into simplier ones.
        We can use new functions or different constructions.

        Having many classes and functions in a single module is a bad thing.
        Soon it will be hard to read through this code and understand it.

    Solution:
        It is better to split this module into several modules or a package.

        Having too many methods might lead to the "God object".
        This kind of objects can handle everything.
        So, in the end your code becomes to hard to maintain and test.

    Solution:
        What to do if you have too many methods in a single class?
        Split this class into several classes.
        Then use composition or inheritance to refactor your code.
        This will protect you from "God object" anti-pattern.

class LineComplexityViolation(ASTStyleViolation):
    """
    This rule forbids to have complex lines.

    We are using Jones Complexity algorithm to count complexity.
    What is Jones Complexity? It is a simple yet power method to count
    the number of ``ast`` nodes per line.
    If the complexity of a single line is higher than a tresshold,
    then an error is raised.

    What nodes do we count? All except the following:

    1. modules
    2. function and classes, since they are checked differently
    3. type annotations, since they do not increase complexity

    Reasoning:
        Having a complex line indicates that you somehow managed to put too
        many logic inside a single line.
        At some point in time you will no longer be able to understand
        what this line means and what it does.

    Solution:
        Split a single line into several lines: by creating new variables,
        statements or functions. Note, this might trigger new complexity issues.
        With this technique a single new node in a line might trigger a complex
        refactoring process including several modules.
